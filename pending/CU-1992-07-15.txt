Alpha-ready CIXCD-AC for VAX 7000 and VAX 10000 Systems

The CIXCD-AC device is a high-performance, intelligent XMI-to-CI interface 
for VAX 7000 and VAX 10000 systems. The CIXCD-AC device has the same 
performance (up to 8 Mbytes per second) and functionality as the current 
CI*** interfaces used on the VAX 9000 (CIXCD-AA) and VAX 6000 (CIXCD-AB) 
systems.

The CIXCD-AC interface is Alpha-ready: you can continue to use it after  
upgrading your new VAX system to an Alpha system. The adapter is also 
backward-compatible with VAX 6000 systems with an XMI bus.
