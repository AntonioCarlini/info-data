DECsystem-10 AND DECSYSTEM-20 SERVICE RETIRING

Digital ceased manufacturing DECsystem-10 and DECSYSTEM-20 systems in 1983 
and announced the retirement of hardware and software support for these 
systems to both Digital and non-Digital users

After December 31, 1993, hardware support services can be performed on a 
best effort (per call) basis only.  Best effort depends primarily on 
existing shelf spares and secondary sources to replace defective material.  
Digital cannot guarantee material availability once these spares sources are 
depleted, because the industry is phasing out of the DECsystem-10 and 
DECSYSTEM-20 chip technology.  

Software product services will be discontinued for the TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 
operating systems on December 31, 1993.  The last engineering updates for 
the operating systems were released in 1990.  Telephone support for many of 
the DECsystem-10 and DECSYSTEM-20 software layered products has already been 
retired.

LLF01 LONG LINE FIBER OPTIC INTERFACE RETIRING

The LLF01 long line fiber optic interface (LLF01-A/B; country kits: 
-MA/MB/KD/KE/KI/KJ) is retiring, with the last orders being accepted June 
30, 1992, and the last shipments July 24, 1992. Services such as spare parts 
and repairs will still be available up to 10 years after the last shipment. 
Service calls will be handled through your normal service channels.

Engineering support will continue to be offered for the life of the product. 
No changes in the current service offerings are expected in the immediate 
future.  Prices will be reviewed on a regular basis.
