VAXft Performance Enhancements

The introduction of the MS520-CB memory option allows the VAXft Model 410, 
610, and 612 systems to support up to 256 Mbytes of memory, an increase in 
memory size of 100 percent. The MS520-CB memory option provides the same 
fault-tolerant features as the 32-Mbyte MS520-BB option; the price has been 
simultaneously reduced.  The MS520-CB and the MS520-BB memory options now 
offer a reduction in cost per Mbyte of 33 percent and 20 percent 
respectively.

VMS V5.5 or higher is required to use the RF73 disk drive. VMS V5.4-3 or 
higher software is required to use the MS520-CB memory.

Full Availability of the RF73 DSSI ISE

The RF73 options were initially announced on October 28, 1991, with limited 
availability.  All variants of the RF73 disk drive are currently available 
with the general release of VMS V5.5 software.
