DIGITAL ALPHA VME 2100

The Digital Alpha VME 2100 system is a variation of the AlphaServer  2100 
systems. Designed for realtime and embedded  applications, the Alpha VME 
2100 offers the popular VME64 I/O bus in place of the EISA bus that is part
of other AlphaServer 2100 systems. It offers users the flexibility to choose 
from over 4,000 existing VMEbus options and combine them with high 
performance PCI options in one integrated rackmountable system package. It 
has CPU, memory, and standard I/O features and  functionality that
are identical to standard AlphaServer 2100 systems. The Alpha VME 2100 
offers 19-inch rackmount packaging for versatility and reduced footprint; 
and runs the Digital UNIX and OpenVMS operating systems.
