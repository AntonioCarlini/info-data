   Backplane Controllers	  Migration: StorageWorks SCSI-2 based
   and HSC Controller Family	  products. For smaller system requirements,
   				  the StorageWorks HSD05 and HSD30 DSSI 
                                  Array Controllers are recommended. For 
                                  larger system requirements, the 
                                  StorageWorks HSJ30 and HSJ40 CI Array 
                                  Controllers or HS1** FDDI Storage Servers

   ALL NON-COMPRESSION VERSIONS	  The non-compression versions of the TKZ60 
   OF TKZ60 IBM 3480 COMPATIBLE	  tape drive are being replaced by TKZ60 
   TAPE DRIVE			  data compression variants that can read 
                                  and write IBM 18-track non-compressed and 
                                  compressed tape media. Thus, the 
                                  recommended migration products are both 
                                  IBM 3480 and 3490 compliant.

   				  In addition, all 2R-TKB60-** VAXBI 
                                  variants (which include a VAXBI/SCSI 
                                  adapter, a 25-foot SCSI cable, and a 
                                  differential SCSI TKZ60 tape drive), have 
                                  been modified to include the TKZ60 
                                  differential SCSI compression version. 
                                  Users who order the old VAXBI 2R-TKB60-** 
                                  model numbers (may not be available in all 
                                  territories) will receive the data 
                                  compression versions of the TKZ60 tape 
                                  drive. However, for daisy chaining 
                                  additional tape drives to the VAXBI 
                                  variants, users should now order the 
                                  TKZ60-GA/GC/HA/HC differential variants.
