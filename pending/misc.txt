IEZ11 SCSI/IEEE488 Bus Converter Option

The IEZ11 device is an IEEE488 bus converter that allows communication 
between VAX systems and IEEE488 instruments. To offer the same features and 
benefits of this product to ULTRIX system based users, the IEZ11 product 
family has been enhanced with the SCSI to IEEE488 Bus Converter Inclusive 
Cable Kit, 120 V (IEZ11-DA) option.

It supports up to 14 
IEEE488 devices and achieves a data throughput of more than 500 Kbytes per 
second.
