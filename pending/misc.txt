IEZ11 SCSI/IEEE488 Bus Converter Option

The IEZ11 device is an IEEE488 bus converter that allows communication 
between VAX systems and IEEE488 instruments. To offer the same features and 
benefits of this product to ULTRIX system based users, the IEZ11 product 
family has been enhanced with the SCSI to IEEE488 Bus Converter Inclusive 
Cable Kit, 120 V (IEZ11-DA) option.

It supports up to 14 
IEEE488 devices and achieves a data throughput of more than 500 Kbytes per 
second.

Super VGA Card for Non-Interlaced Monitors


The 1024 x 768 non-interlaced adapter (PCXAG-AC) is an IBM PC/AT compatible 
option board that provides 640 x 480 resolution with 256 colors or 1024 x 
768 resolution with 16 color super VGA capability for DECpc and DECstation 
series personal computers. With a video memory upgrade of 512 Kbytes, 
monitors will display with 1024 x 768 resolution and 256 colors.

The adapter consists of the PVGA1D video subsystem, BIOS, display memory, 
RAMDAC, board configuration circuitry, and I/O to the host computer. The 
hardware is transparent to you. Its associated BIOS firmware provides the 
interface between your application and the hardware.


Graphic Memory Upgrade for Super VGA Card



The PC4GM-AA is a 512 Kbyte, 70 nanosecond, graphic memory upgrade kit.  
When used on the 1024 x 768 non-interlaced super video graphics adapter 
(PCXAG-AC), it allows you to operate at a resolution of 1024 x 768 and 
display 256 colors on DECpc and DECstation series personal computers.


Industry Standard Floppy Drive with Brackets

The PCXDR-AA is an industry standard 3.5-inch, 1.44 Mbyte floppy drive with 
two brackets for mounting in 5.25-inch bay DECpc and DECstation series 
personal computers.
