o  DEC LANcontroller 602 -- The DEC LANcontroller 602 network interface card 
   has two Ethernet ports for high performance bridging and routing with a 
   choice of thick wire, ThinWire, or UTP connectors. The DEC LANcontroller 
   602 provides high performance bridging and routing, with 14,880 pps full 
   media rate filtering, and around 12,000 pps for bridge forwarding and IP 
   routing. Performance increases as more DEC LANcontroller 602s are added, 
   providing performance in excess of 70,000 pps for IP routing and bridging 
   between seven Ethernet pairs for a fully populated DECNIS 600 enclosure.


HSC65 and HSC95

The embedded HSC 
cache will be 32 Mbytes at initial ship, but a future software release will 
upgrade the cache module to 64 Mbytes at no extra charge.

HSC High Performance Software V7.0 Included

The HSC65 and HSC95 controllers are supported on VMS V5.4-1; Digital expects 
support in a future release of the ULTRIX operating system, but no support 
is planned for VAX System V software.

o  HSC65, HSC95 Devices
   - Initial availability: September 18, 1992
   - FastShip: October 15, 1992

o  HSS65 and HSS95 VAXcluster Starter Packages
   - Initial availability: September 18, 1992

TZ30, TK50, and TK70 Read Compatibility

Now both Tx86 and Tx867 drives can read the older TZ30, TK50, and TK70 tape 
formats. This increased functionality means that the Tx86 family of products 
can be used as software load devices (most Digital software is distributed 
on TK50 media). Choose the Tx85 family for fast backup times, high capacity, 
and lower cost. With up to 42 Gbytes of unattended backup per seven 
cartridge magazine, choose the Tx86 family of products when higher capacity 
is required. Both families offer the same functionality.

LATprint Ethernet Interface

The LATprint product is a two port ThinWire Ethernet interface that provides 
a cost-effective network server dedicated to printers. Because it can 
integrate two serial printer connections into a distributed computing 
network, the printers become shared resources, available to any host and to 
any user on the Ethernet local area network (LAN).

REPLACEMENT OPTIONS FOR MS01-AA AND MS02-AA MEMORY

Product Description

The MS01L-AB memory option has replaced the MS0l-AA option for DECstation 
5000 Models 20, 25, 33, 100, 120, 125, and 133. The MS01L-AB can not be used 
on DECstation 2100 and 3100 systems (see the chart below). The MS01L-AB uses 
4 Mbit DRAM technology; the MS01-AA uses 1 Mbit DRAM technology.

The MS02L-AB memory option has replaced the MS02-AA option. The MS02L-AB is 
an 8 Mbyte ECC memory for the DECstation and DECsystem 5000 Models 200 and 
240 and the DECsystem 5900 system. The new MS02L-AB uses 4 Mbit DRAM 
technology; the MS02-AA uses 1 Mbit DRAM technology.

HSC60 AND HSC90 END OF MANUFACTURING LIFE

Manufacturing is ending for the HSC60 and HSC90 controllers and MG-EIC 
rackmount HSC products. All related variants and upgrade kits are being 
retired. 

The last build for HSC60 and HSC90 controllers will be January 1993; the 
last order date will be December 30, 1992. Complete packages for migration 
to the HSC65 and HSC95 controllers will be available for HSC users (see the 
"New High Performance HSC Controllers" article in this issue for further 
information).

RACKMOUNT VAX 6000 MODEL 400 ON MAINTENANCE STATUS

The Rackmount VAX 6000 Model 400 system has moved to maintenance-only 
status. The last date for orders was September 30, 1992. Delivery must be 
taken before December 31, 1992.

Digital recommends that for cost-effective expansion you consider Rackmount 
VAX 6000 Models 510 and 610.


TWO MicroVAX 3100 MODELS AND DSH32 OPTION RETIRING

MicroVAX 3100 Model 10e systems for the OpenVMS and ULTRIX operating systems 
and MicroVAX 3100 Model 20e systems for the ULTRIX operating system are 
retiring, along with the DSH32 communications option.

The last order date for the systems is March 31, 1993; the last ship date is 
June 30, 1993. The last order date for the DSH32 communications option is 
September 30, 1993; the last ship date is December 30, 1993.

All MicroVAX 3100 Model 10e and 20e OpenVMS systems have been replaced by 
the MicroVAX 3100 Model 30, 40, 80, and 90 systems. The following migration 
paths show the performance enhancements you can achieve:

	MicroVAX 3100 Model 10e	 ---------->  Model 30
		      3.5 VUPS	 	      5.0 VUPS

	MicroVAX 3100 Model 20e	 ---------->  Models 40, 80, and higher
		      3.5 VUPS	 	      5.0 VUPS 	  10.0 VUPS

After the last order dates, the systems and the communications option will 
be on maintenance-only status. Refurbished systems will continue to be 
offered, subject to availability.
