POWERSTORM FAMILY OF GRAPHICS ACCELERATORS

The PowerStorm 3D10 is a single-slot, DRAM PCI-bus graphics accelerator 
designed for use in a range of 2-D applications and low-end 3-D graphics 
applications. With up to 2 MB of DRAM and 8-bit planes, the PowerStorm 
3D10 integrates a RAMDAC on-chip to provide cost-effective 2-D and 3-D 
graphics on AlphaStation workstations.

The PowerStorm 3D30 graphics accelerator is a single-slot, PCI-based 
module designed for 2-D and 8-bit 3-D wireframe applications. The 
PowerStorm 3D30 is 8 bits per pixel, offering simultaneous display of 256 
colors. It has special hardware functionality via a patented dithering 
algorithm, which allows the display of virtual 24-bit images.

The PowerStorm 4D20 graphics accelerator is also a single-slot, PCI-based 
module designed for 3-D wireframe applications and cost-sensitive users 
requiring 3-D solids modeling functionality. This graphics accelerator 
offers up to 24 bits per pixel double buffered (can display up to 16.7 
million colors simultaneously), 4 overlay planes, and a full 24-bit 
Z-buffer for 3-D depth cueing. The PowerStorm 4D20 also supports 
1600x1200 resolution at 75 Hz to provide higher quality resolution and 
larger screen sizes.
