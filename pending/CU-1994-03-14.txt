DECpc XL Server

The DECpc XL server will be available April 15, 1994, in either kernel or 
base system configurations. Because the server can operate in a variety of 
operating environments, it does not come preloaded with any operating 
system. The operating system is purchased as a separate line item. Drivers 
for most major operating systems do come preloaded on the included bootable 
CDROM (to load drivers not included on the CDROM, please contact your local 
Digital sales office).
