T-1 CSU RETIRING

The T-1 CSU (DFD02-AA) is retiring. All remaining orders must be placed 
before June 30, 1992. Maintenance will still be provided for current users.

SELECTED VAX MEMORY OPTIONS RETIRING

Selected VAX memory options will be retired on August 31, 1992. These 
options can be ordered until July 31, 1992; last shipment will be on August 
31, 1992.  

Digital will continue to support the VAX memory options with its complete 
range of service products for a minimum of seven years after the end of the 
product's manufacturing life. The availability of refurbished memory, spare 
parts, and trained engineers is ensured as a part of the standard retirement 
planning.

Model Numbers Retiring/Replacement Product

Model No.   Description	                                 Replacement Product

MS730-CA    1 MB Memory card for the VAX 11/730		 None
MS750-CA    1 MB Memory card for the VAX 11/750		 MS750-HB
MS780-FA    2 MB Memory card for the VAX 11/780		 MS780-JD
MS88-AA	    4 MB Memory card for the VAX 8500, 8700, 	 MS88-CA/MS88-DA 
	    and 8800
MS60-AA	    8 MB Memory card for the VAXstation 	 MS60-BA/MS60-CA
	    3520 and 3540

The MS750-HB card is an 8 Mbyte memory card that can be used on the VAX 
11/750 system. To use the MS750-HB card as a replacement product, the 
MS750-CA card must be removed. The MS780-JD card is a 4 Mbyte memory card 
that can replace the MS780-FA card. To use the MS780-JD card as a 
replacement product, the MS780-FA card must be removed. Larger, denser 
arrays (MS88-CA/DA and MS60-BA/CA cards) are available for the VAX 8500, 
8700, and 8800 systems and VAXstation 3520 and 3540 workstations.

RSX P.S.I./M AND M-PLUS RETIRING

Digital is retiring the RSX P.S.I./M and M-PLUS products. 

There is no Digital product that directly replaces the RSX P.S.I./M and  
P.S.I./M-PLUS for PDP-11 systems.  Users requiring future X.25 support on 
PDP-11 systems have the following two options:

o  Digital KMV1A synchronous device plus RSX X.25 Link Level software 
   available from EIC.

o  Third-party PCM board plus link level software from vendors such as 
   Simpact (ICP 1622).

Users migrating to VAX systems can migrate to the VAX P.S.I product.
