CMOS-4 Chip Manufacturing Technology

Previous CMOS generations have delivered the world's fastest CISC 
microprocessors in Digital's products. For example, in 1990 CMOS-3 delivered 
a 62.5 MHz chip in the VAX 6000 Model 500 series. CMOS-4 has delivered an 83 
MHz chip in the VAX 6000 Model 600 series. Digital is now using this same 
technology to manufacture the Alpha CPU and a wide range of peripheral 
chips.

Alpha -- The Fastest Microprocessor

o  Digital announces the Alpha microprocessor (21064-AA), the first 
   chip-level implementation of the Alpha architecture

o  The Alpha chip is the fastest CMOS microprocessor available in the world, 
   with a clock rate of up to 200 MHz  



With a total transistor count of 1.68 million devices, the 21064-AA chip is 
a complete CPU, including full integer and floating-point execution units.  
These units, together with related addressing and branching units, are fully 
pipelined, and each is capable of launching a new operation every cycle.

In addition, the chip includes two high-speed primary caches. An 8 Kbyte 
instruction cache provides two full 32-bit instructions per clock cycle to 
the instruction dispatch unit, and an 8 Kbyte data cache can provide 64-bit 
data access during each cycle. The resulting cache bandwidth of 3.2 
Gbytes per second far exceeds what could be accomplished if these cache 
units were not fully integrated.

The 21064-AA microprocessor is available now for your evaluation. Production 
quantities will be available in July 1992.
