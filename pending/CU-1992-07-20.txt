OpenVMS Restrictions/Comments

X = Not supported.
0 = No restrictions.
1 = This system cannot boot from this tape.
2 = Cannot perform odd byte transfers.  All SCSI devices are affected, but 
    this problem is rare or non-existent with standard OpenVMS tape 
    utilities, since one normally specifies byte counts as even numbers.
3 = OpenVMS SHOW DEVICE command will indicate "generic SCSI tape" and ERROR 
    LOGGING will indicate "GENERIC MK SUBSYSTEM".  This will have little 
    impact on most applications.
4 = In this version of OpenVMS software, STABACKIT.COM (standalone backup) 
    is not supported.  You cannot create a standalone backup tape.
5 = Sequential autoloading of tapes is not supported, for example, when 
    doing a multivolume BACKUP (the timeout is too short for the cycling 
    operation). Therefore, operator intervention will be required.
6 = Writing CompacTape III media with the Tx85 format is not supported, 
    since OpenVMS and ULTRIX software does not support density select.

ULTRIX Supported Systems (see ULTRIX Restrictions/Comments below)

NOTE: ULTRIX software prior to the V4.2c release does not support tape file 
      lengths greater than 2.147 Gbytes. This is not an issue for local disk 
      backup, since disk file systems are also limited to 2.147 Gbytes.  
      However, certain applications may be capable of writing more than this 
      amount of data to a tape and might react inappropriately to errors 
      that can result when trying to do I/O or positioning past this 
      software limit.
 
ULTRIX Restrictions/Comments

0 = No restrictions.
a = Writing CompacTape III media with the Tx85 format is not supported, 
    since operating system support of density selection is not available.
b = Tape exerciser indicates inappropriate errors. Errors should be ignored 
    (fixed in ULTRIX V4.2c).
c = Sequential autoloading supported only when using the "mt off-line" 
    command.
d = Dump/restore utilities are the only utilities that support sequential 
    autoloading.
e = Booting is not supported; all other tape operations are supported.

TLZ06 4.0 GB 4 mm Digital Audio Tape (DAT)

The TLZ06 drive is the second member of Digital's 4 mm Digital Audio Tape 
(DAT) family. It is smaller and faster than its predecessor, the TLZ04 tape 
drive, and has a greater capacity and a lower price. These improvements make 
it an excellent solution for backup, archiving, and data interchange on 
small and midrange systems.

POSITIONING

The following low-end and midrange tape drives offered by Digital are either 
Digital manufactured or purchased from external suppliers:

** Maximum theoretical transfer across bus with buffering. MicroVAX 3100 
   Model 30, 40, 80, and 90 systems support actual maximum 4.0 Mbytes per 
   second synchronous; therefore, a 10 Mbyte per second transfer rate is not 
   achievable on MicroVAX 3100 systems at this time.

The RZ26 SCSI disk can be ordered now on MicroVAX 3100 Model 30, 40, 80, and 
90 systems.

MS7AA-CA	 256 MB VAX 7000 and VAX 10000 memory
MS7AA-DA	 512 MB VAX 7000 and VAX 10000 memory

Digital's new MS44-DC and MS44L-BC memory options optimize the performance 
of the recently announced VAXstation 4000 Model 90, MicroVAX 3100 Model 90, 
and compact VAX 4000 Model 100 systems. Designed in conjunction with the 
system architectures, the new options provide flexibility and large 
capacity.  You can configure your VAXstation 4000 Model 90, MicroVAX 3100 
Model 90, and compact VAX 4000 Model 100 systems with the right amount of 
memory to satisfy your increasing application and performance needs. Adding 
memory reduces accesses to disk storage and increases throughput and/or 
improves response times in many application environments.

RF31 AND RF31F RETIRING

The RF31E-AA, AF, SA, and SF options are 381 Mbyte DSSI 5.25-inch integrated 
storage elements primarily for the VAX 4000 Model 200 and VAX 4000 Model 300 
systems.  They are being replaced by the RF31T-AA, AF, SA, and SF options, 
which are 381 Mbyte DSSI 3.5-inch integrated storage elements.

Despite the difference in form factors of the two drives, the RF31T drive is 
recognized as an RF31 by OpenVMS V5.3 and later.

You will see increased benefits in performance at a low price with the new 
RF31T drive. One RF31T drive fits into the same physical space as the RF31 
drive and has more than double the performance.  You also have the option of 
putting two RF31T drives in the same 5.25-inch slot that previously held one 
RF31 drive. Adding the two RF31T drives increases performance by more than 
four times over the RF31 drive.


TLZ04 1.2 GB 4 MM DAT DRIVE RETIRING

The TLZ04 DAT drive will be replaced by the next generation 4 mm DAT drive, 
the TLZ06 (refer to the announcement article in this issue). The TLZ06 tape 
has four times the capacity of the TLZ04 tape drive, twice the performance, 
a smaller form factor, and a lower price.

The TLZ06 tape drive has complete read and write compatibility with the 
TLZ04 drive, ensuring coexistence and allowing investment protection for 
your original purchase.

The TLZ04 drive comes in a 5.25-inch full-height form factor.  The 3.5-inch 
TLZ06 drive takes up half the space of a TLZ04 drive and provides 5.25-inch 
adapter bracketry for enclosures that can accommodate only 5.25-inch 
removable media devices.  In addition, the unused half of the 5.25-inch 
cavity can be filled with a half-height RRD42 CDROM for software 
distribution and loading, at a combined price that is less than the price of 
a TLZ04 drive. This savings makes migrating from the TLZ04 drive to the 
TLZ06 drive a very attractive solution, and the TLZ06 drive is the tape 
drive of choice for many new Digital systems and workstations.
