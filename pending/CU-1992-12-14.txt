RZ26 Disk

o  1050 Mbyte (formatted) 3.5 inch SCSI-2 Winchester disk drive -- 146 
   percent more capacity than the RZ25 426 Mbyte (formatted) disk
o  21 percent lower price per megabyte than the RZ25 disk
o  32 percent faster average seek time than the RZ25 disk
o  27 percent faster access time than all 3.5 inch disks, because of higher 
   rotational speed 
o  Up to 35 percent higher maximum random I/O

RSX-11M-PLUS AND Micro/RSX V4.3 QUEUE MANAGER UPDATE

The queue manager in V4.3 and prior versions of RSX 11M-PLUS and Micro/RSX 
software contains a problem that will appear beginning January 1, 1993. Jobs 
that are queued for execution on a specified date/time after December 31, 
1992, will be executed immediately. The problem occurs because the date 
field stored in the queue file (QUEUE.SYS) is not large enough to represent 
a date after December 31, 1992. The queue manager update kit will correct 
this problem and support dates up to the year 2000. The complete 
implementation of this change will be included in V4.4 of the RSX-11M-PLUS 
and Micro/RSX products.

RQDX3 INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER RETIRING

The RQDX3 intelligent Q-bus controller supports RD50/51/52/53/54 Winchester 
disks and RX33 floppy disk drives on PDP-11 and MicroVAX systems. 

It will move to maintenance only status December 24, 1992; its last ship 
date will be March 26, 1993. Orders will be processed until December 24 or 
until certain limited parts are no longer available.

RT1000 and other PDP-11 users will need to order the RQDX3 controller before 
December 24, 1992, as there is no other Digital supplied storage subsystem 
for migration.
