Notes:

*   The Model 10e enclosure is the same size as the Model 30 enclosure; 
    however, there are internal and back panel differences. The same 
    situation exists for the Model 20e compared to the Model 40 and 80 
    systems.

**  MicroVAX 3100 Model 10e system combines the 8 asynchronous lines and 1 
    synchronous line in the DSH32 option.  The MicroVAX 3100 Model 30, 40, 
    and 80 systems can be configured with either the additional asynchronous 
    lines or modem lines, but not both.

*** You can add three RZ25 drives internally to all models of the MicroVAX 
    3100 system. In addition, you can add four RZ57 drives to the MicroVAX 
    3100 Model 10e, but the drives must be added externally. You can also 
    add four RZ58 drives to the MicroVAX 3100 Model 30, 40, and 80 system, 
    but these must be added externally as well.



o  The Model 30 and 40 systems use the system-on-a-chip (SOC) CPU that 
   combines the CPU, FPU, clock, and 6 Kbytes of cache on one chip.  This 
   high-performance CPU is also used in the VAX 4000 Model 200 system.

o  The Model 80 uses a chip set that includes the CPU, FPU, clock, and over 
   128 Kbytes of cache. This higher performance CPU is also used in the VAX 
   6000 Model 500 system.


The MicroVAX 3100 Model 30 and 40 systems support 
up to 32 Mbytes of memory. The maximum configuration is attained by adding 
three MS44L-BA SIMMs to 8 Mbytes of on-board memory.  The MicroVAX 3100 
Model 80 supports up to 72 Mbytes of memory.  The maximum configuration is 
attained by adding two MS44-DA SIMMs to 8 Mbytes of on-board memory.

EtherWORKS Router/DECnet V1.0

The EtherWORKS Router/DECnet V1.0 software is a communications product that 
provides routing service for DECnet nodes on an Ethernet/802.3 LAN.

The new 
EtherWORKS Router DE206-AA hardware is a PC/AT bus-compatible, full-size 
option card that is based on a Motorola MC68302 with embedded 68000 
processor. The associated EtherWORKS Router/DECnet V1.0 software is a DECnet 
Phase IV product that supports intra-area (Level 1) and inter-area (Level 2) 
routing of messages between DECnet nodes.

TF85 AND TF857 ERROR IN SYSTEMS AND OPTIONS CATALOG

There is an error in the Systems and Options Catalog on page 8.104, in the 
section entitled "Tape Comparison Chart": The "Typical Time to Back Up 1 
Gbyte Disk (minutes)" shows the TF85/TF857 drives taking up to 40 minutes to 
back up 1 Gbyte of disk storage. The correct figure should be 24 minutes. 
Note that the TF85 and TF857 drives have won the 1992 Digital Review Target 
Award as best tape products.


RETIREMENT OF FOUR COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS

The four items listed below will move to maintenance-only status on 
January 24, 1992.
