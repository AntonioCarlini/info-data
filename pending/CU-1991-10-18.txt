The DEC WANcontroller 618 product supports up to eight synchronous line 
interfaces at speeds from 1.2 Kbits per second to 56 or 64 Kbits per second.  
A separate distribution panel is required to connect to specific physical 
interface standard cables.  A 50-way loopback connector is provided.  Order 
the appropriate DNSCA package which includes the correct distribution panel 
(V.35, V.11, or EIA 232).

The DEC WANcontroller 622 supports up to two synchronous line interfaces at 
speeds from 56 Kbits per second up to 2048 Kbits per second. Separate 
physical interface adapter cables are required to connect the two standard 
50-way connectors to the required physical interface connector. A 50-way 
loopback connector is provided.  Order the appropriate DNSCB package which 
includes the correct adapter cables (V.35 or V.11 cables).

The DEC LANcontroller 601 is a single port IEEE 802.3/Ethernet network 
interface card.
