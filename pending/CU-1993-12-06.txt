Alpha AXP Graphics Update

ZLX-E1 ACCELERATOR FOR Alpha AXP WORKSTATIONS

GRAPHICS SUPPORT FOR DECpc AXP/150 AND DEC 2000 MODEL 300

The DECpc AXP/150 and DEC 2000 Model 300 Windows NT platforms now support 
the Number Nine GXE (S3) 1280 x 1024 graphics accelerator. This 8 plane, 33M 
Winmark video card provides the high resolution and performance demanded by 
graphics intensive simulation, modeling, visualization, and CAD/CAM 
applications. The Windows NT operating system supports both the COMPAQ 
QVision 1024 x 768 (8M Winmarks) graphics card and the Number Nine GXE card 
from Digital.

The OpenVMS and DEC OSF/1 operating systems support the COMPAQ QVision card 
on the DEC 2000 Model 300 platform. You can now order OpenVMS and DEC OSF/1 
2D graphics workstations by purchasing the DEC 2000 Model 300 and adding the 
QVision card and monitor according to the ordering rules for the DECpc 
AXP/150 system. Note that to fully utilize the EISA configuration utility, 
you must configure OpenVMS and DEC OSF/1 DEC 2000 Model 300 systems with 
graphics.
