DECstation FAMILY POSITIONING

The DECstation family meets the requirements of professional users, both 
technical and commercial, looking for more performance and functionality 
than can be provided by PCs, with the ACE initiative providing further 
evolution towards low-cost, high-performance computing. The following table 
compares the three new members of the DECstation family.

Personal DECstation 5000 Series

The Personal DECstation 5000 family consists of the Personal DECstation 5000 
Model 20, the Personal DECstation 5000 Model 25, and the DECsystem 5000 
Model 25.

Custom systems that include 8 Mbytes of memory can add up to two MS01-AA 
units (total system = 16 Mbytes) or two MS01-CA units (total system = 40 
Mbytes). MS01-AA (1 Mbit DRAM) memory cannot be mixed with MS01-CA (4 Mbit 
DRAM) memory.

MS01-CA		   16 MB factory installed memory (4 Mbit DRAM)

DECstation 5000 Model 133

DECstation 5000 Model 240 and DECsystem 5000 Model 240

The DECstation 5000 Model 240 32.4 SPECmarks

The DECstation 5000 Model 240 includes:

o  MIPS R3400B CPU/FPU at 40 MHz
o  128 Kbyte cache--64 Kbyte instruction/64 Kbyte data
o  16 Mbyte memory expandable in 8 Mbyte increments (1 Mbit DRAM) to 120 
   Mbytes
o  32 Mbyte option (4 Mbit DRAM), allowing memory expansion to 480 Mbytes
o  Integral DMA SCSI--supports up to seven external devices
o  Integral DMA thickwire Ethernet controller
o  Two 25-pin synchronous/asynchronous ports
o  Three TURBOchannel slots at 100 Mbytes per sec (25 MHz)

DECsystem 5000 Model 240

The DECsystem 5000 Model 240 uses the same technology as the DECstation 5000 
Model 240 without the graphics options. This allows the DECsystem 5000 Model 
240 to be used as a compute server, a file server, or a peripheral server.

Recent price reductions on the DECsystem 5100, DECsystem 5000 Model 200, 
DECsystem 5500 systems, and DECsystem 5400 to DECsystem 5500 upgrade offer 
you price savings of up to 37 percent. These systems have proven track 
records as outstanding systems for both commercial and technical UNIX 
applications.  In addition, recent advances in compiler technology have 
enabled the DECsystem systems to achieve 15 percent improvement in CPU 
performance benchmarks.  These performance increases, combined with lower 
system prices, mean improved price/performance for you.

Digital's new MS690 memories are especially designed to maximize the 
performance of VAX 4000 Model 500 systems through a tight integration with 
the system architecture.  The memory subsystem's 64 bit wide data path is 
twice the width of other VAX 4000 systems, boosting memory performance to 
support the faster processors. Three memory options--128 Mbyte (MS690-DA),  
64 Mbyte (MS690-CA), and 32 Mbyte (MS690-BA) offer extensive configuration 
flexibility and maximum memory capacity of 512 Mbytes. The MS690 memory 
options are built from advanced semiconductor parts--4 Mbit DRAMs in the 
MS690-CA and MS690-DA and 1 Mbit DRAMs in the MS690-BA memory--and offer 
ECC-based reliability.

VAX 4000 MEMORY OPTION CHART

The following chart lists the various models of the VAX 4000 system and the 
memory options you can order for a specific model.
