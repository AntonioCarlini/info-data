PHASEDOWN OF LK200 FAMILY OF KEYBOARDS

    ===================================================================
       
    o  The LK200 series of keyboards will move to maintenance-only 
       status on March 15, 1992
    
    o  The LK400 series of keyboards will be direct replacements for 
       the LK200 series of keyboards


LK207-**

There is no plan to replace the LK207-** keyboard. Last build will take 
place in March 1992.

LK250-**

A replacement for the LK250 keyboard is under development, with announcement 
expected later in 1991. 


LK401 Keyboard

The LK401 keyboard is similar to the LK201 keyboard, but Digital has made it 
2 inches shorter, added three new keys on the row with the space bar (right 
compose key and two ALT-Function keys), distinguished between the left and 
right shift keys to send unique scan codes, removed the Compose and Wait 
LEDs, and labeled the top row function keys (F1-F20) directly, eliminating a 
permanent legend strip.

The VSXXX-AA Boston mouse will move to maintenance-only status on December 
13, 1991; no further orders are being accepted and the last build will take 
place by December 27, 1991; final shipments will be made by the spring of 
1992.


The VSXXX-GA Logitech mouse will be a direct replacement for the VSXXX-AA 
Boston mouse.  The VSXXX-GA has a rectangular design rather than the round 
design of the Boston mouse but is otherwise directly comparable with it. The 
VSXXX-GA mouse began shipping in October 1991.

  The phasedown schedule for the DECsystem 5800 system/server is:
    
       - Last order date: December 31, 1991
