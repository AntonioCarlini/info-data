The RapidPrint 200 is a network interface box that directly replaces the 
DECserver 250. Unlike the DECserver 250, it supports Alpha and Digital UNIX 
(formerly called DEC OSF/1) platforms. It has two ports: one serial and one 
parallel. Both ports can be active simultaneously.

   PRODUCT/SERVICE                NOTES

   ALL VAX SYSTEMS AND            The new VAX upgrades (see "VAX to VAX 
   UPGRADES WITH OLD		  Upgrades" article in the April 1995 issue 
   WARRANTY			  of Digital's Customer Update) and 
                                  ADVANTAGE SERVER 
   				  systems with the new three-year warranty 
                                  (see articles on VAX 4000 Model 106A, 
   				  VAXstation 4000 Model 96, and MicroVAX 
                                  3100 Model 96 in the April 1995 issue of 
                                  Digital's Customer Update) are replacing 
                                  the corresponding older VAX products with 
                                  the one-year warranty, except for the VAX 
                                  7000 which carries a one-year warranty at 
                                  list price. Note also that most Base 
                                  Systems and some ADVANTAGE SERVERS with 
                                  low memory content do not have a migration 
                                  product.

   				  As of July 1, 1995 -- one month prior to 
                                  the last order date -- all of the retiring 
                                  VAX systems and upgrades will increase in 
                                  price by 10 percent in the U.S. In Europe, 
                                  this increase was effective May 2, 1995,
   				  and some older VAX to VAX upgrades have 
                                  already been retired. The standard 
                                  trade-in policy applies in Europe; 
                                  standard system part numbers are used 
                                  instead of special upgrade part numbers, 
                                  with the exception of the SMP upgade part 
                                  numbers.

                                  older VAX systems and upgrades)
