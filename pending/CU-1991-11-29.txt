VT1300 MIGRATION OPTIONS

The VT1300 terminal, announced by Digital in September 1990, uses the VAXELN 
Window Server Software (EWS) to obtain DECwindows functionality and provide 
color X Window terminal capability. The upgrade choices available to VT1300 
users provide both investment protection and a growth path to new products 
and technologies.


Digital's Enhanced SCO MPX R1.2 for UNIX
Digital Enhanced SCO MPX Release 1.2 for UNIX software is an enhanced 
version of SCO's MPX V1.1 and is designed for use with SCO UNIX V3.2.2 
running on the applicationDEC 433MP system.  This enhanced version greatly 
improves the multiprocessing capabilities of the 433MP system.
