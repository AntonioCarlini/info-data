ESE50 Solid State Disk


The ESE50 disk has the same form factor as an RA92 drive and can be 
configured in the SA900 series storage array cabinet along with magnetic 
disk products. It will be available initially in two capacities: 120 Mbytes 
and 600 Mbytes.


TEMPEST DECstation 333c and TEMPEST DECstation 425c

The TEMPEST DECstation 333c is an 80386, 33 MHz personal computer with 32 
Kbytes of cache. The combination of processor speed and cache memory makes 
the TEMPEST DECstation 333c system ideal for applications requiring 
intensive processing, such as windowing and networked database applications. 
The same combination also makes the system ideal as an OS/2 server, 
providing unparalleled integration and interoperablility of OS/2 PCs.

The TEMPEST DECstation 425c system is based on Intel's powerful 80486 chip. 
It features full expandability, 8 Kbytes of internal cache memory, and 25 
MHz speed.  

Both the DECstation 333c and DECstation 425c systems offer a new removable 
hard disk complementing the TEMPEST and physical security features.

o  High-performance Intel microprocessors: 25 MHz 80486 for TEMPEST 
   DECstation 425c system and 33 MHz 80386 for TEMPEST DECstation 333c 
   system

o  14-inch color monitor (1024 x 768); 16-inch monitor optional

o  2 Mbytes of memory, expandable to 8 Mbytes on a memory expansion card

o  Maximum memory 16 Mbytes via a second memory expansion card

o  32 Kbytes of internal cache memory (TEMPEST DECstation 333c system) or 8 
   Kbytes of internal cache memory (TEMPEST DECstation 425c system)

o  Three available disk storage bays: one 3.5-inch, two 5.25-inch

o  3.5-inch, 1.4 Mbyte floppy drive

o  5.25-inch, 1.2 Mbyte floppy drive optional

o  Removable hard disk options: 52, 104, 150, 209, and 426 Mbytes

o  Math coprocessor (WEITEK 4167) optional

o  Six available option slots: four full, two half

o  Complete with mouse, 101-key keyboard, and serial port (additional serial 
   port and parallel port optional)

o  Supports VGA graphics

o  ISA-bus type

o  Integrated IDE interface

o  200 W power supply

64 Mbyte VAXft Base Systems and Servers

The new 64 Mbyte VAXft Model 410, 610, and 612 base systems and servers are 
attractively priced when compared both with 32 Mbyte VAXft systems and 
servers and with systems and servers from other vendors.

VAXft systems allow for a maximum of four memory options. When you use the 
MS520-CB 64 Mbyte memory options, you can grow these configurations 
cost-effectively to the maximum of 256 Mbytes, a 100 percent increase in 
memory size. While substantially reducing the cost of adding 32 Mbytes of 
memory, these new options also free an additional module option slot. You 
can use this for an extra Ethernet/DSSI option for multirail Ethernet 
configurations, or for a WAN controller 620 synchronous communications 
option.
