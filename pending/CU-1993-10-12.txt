TKZ60 Tape Drive Compatible with TA90 and IBM 3480 Format

TECHNICAL DATA

With the retirement of the TA90 and TA91 tape drives in June 1993, the TKZ60 
is the only tape drive available from Digital that has both read and write 
compatibility with IBM 3480 tape drives. Digital also offers the TA92 36 
track, IBM 3490E compatible tape drive for datacenter environments where 
high performance or higher capacity per cartridge is a requirement. The TA92 
drive is backwards read compatible with 18 track drives, such as the TKZ60, 
TA90, TA90E, and TA91 drives. However, tape cartridges that have been 
written on the TA92 drive can not be read on 18 track drives.


HSC High Performance Software V8.3 provides TSZ07, TKZ09, and TKZ60 tape 
support on the HSC SCSI channel card. HSC users thus obtain 1600/6250 bpi 
reel-to-reel and 8 mm tape capability and 18 track TA90 and IBM 3480 tape 
compatibility, respectively, for their data interchange or backup needs. All 
three of these SCSI interfaced tape devices can now be connected to the HSC 
SCSI channel card. The SCSI interface allows up to seven SCSI devices to be 
configured on the same HSC channel card.
