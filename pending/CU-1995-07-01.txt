ALL AlphaServer 2000 4/200     The AlphaServer 2000 4/200 pedestal systems
PEDESTAL SYSTEMS; 	       and AlphaServer 2100 4/200 pedestal, 
AlphaServer 2100 4/200         rackmount, and cabinet systems are being
PEDESTAL, RACKMOUNT, AND       replaced by the new AlphaServer 2000 4/233
Cabinet Systems; AND           systems, respectively.  The 4/233 models
AlphaServer 2100 4/275	       have features similar to those of the 
SYSTEMS WITH RZ28-VA NARROW    Model 4/200, but with a faster 233 MHz
SCSI DISKS  		       processor. Pricing for the new 4/233 systems 
                               is also the same as for the 4/200 systems. 
                               Note that no upgrade from the 4/200 to the 
                               4/233 models will be offered. The AlphaServer 
                               2100 4/275 pedestal systems with the RZ28-VA 
                               narrow SCSI disk are being replaced with 
                               AlphaServer 2100 4/275 systems that contain
                               an RZ28-VW wide SCSI disk. The AlphaServer 
                               2100 4/275 rackmount and cabinet systems have 
                               been re-numbered (see "AlphaServer 2100
                               Rackmount and Cabinet Systems" in the April 
                               1995 issue of Sales Update); the older 
                               numbers have been retired.

                               wish to get the latest 1-2-3 functionality,

POLYCENTER STRIPING FOR
OpenVMS VAX
                               POLYCENTER Striping software implements disk
                               striping for OpenVMS VAX systems. This gives 
                               users the ability to create one or more
                               stripe sets, each comprised of two or more 
                               physical disks. Disk striping interleaves 
                               multiple disks to improve I/O performance.
