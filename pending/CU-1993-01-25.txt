PCXAT-BB

The PCXAT-BB is a low cost, high performance quarter inch cartridge (QIC) 
tape drive. It provides capacities of 80 or 120 Mbytes of uncompressed data, 
or 160 or 250 Mbytes of compressed data, using software data compression, on 
205 ft or 307 ft DC2000 series standard cartridges. The PCXAT-BB can be 
configured internally in either a 3.5 inch or 5.25 inch cavity. It uses the 
QIC minicartridge (TZK2X-CA, single cartridge); a five pack (TZK2X-CB) is 
also available.

The PCXAT-BB uses a QIC-117 floppy drive interface supporting IBM PC XT/AT 
compatibles via a floppy drive controller either on the mother board or on 
an adapter card. It coexists with up to two floppy drives on the same floppy 
drive controller.

The PCXAT-BB is an MS-DOS only product at present.

PERFORMANCE

The PCXAR-AG measures 7 to 8 million Winmarks on a 386/33 CPU at 1024 x 768 
resolution with 256 colors. This compares with 1 to 1.5 million Winmarks for 
the PCXAG-AC. The performance is very visible in 1024 x 768 and 1280 x 1024 
modes under Windows.
