DECpc LPx 560 and LPx 566

Digital's new, cost-efficient DECpc LPx 560 and DECpc LPx 566 
full-profile-enclosure Pentium PCs provide high performance and a PCI local 
bus architecture at entry level prices. Orderable in five different desktop 
packages for the budget conscious business professional, they come 
preinstalled with MS-DOS 6.2 and Microsoft Windows 3.1 software. Also 
available are: IBM OS/2 V2.1, SCO UNIX V4.2, SCO ODT V3.0, Novell NetWare 
V2.2, V3.1.2, and V4.01, Novell Unixware V1.1, Novell SFT III V3.11, 
PATHWORKS V4.1, and Microsoft Windows NT V3.1.

o  Pentium processor family (60 or 66 MHz).
o  P5T overdrive ready, increasing internal CPU speed.
o  Choice of S3 928 PCI (30M Winmarks) or Diamond Viper PCI (80M Winmarks) 
   graphics cards.
o  Integrated IDE controller.
o  Six slots (two PCI, three ISA, one interleaved).
o  Five bays (one internal, four external).
o  340 or 540 Mbyte IDE options.
o  1.44 Mbyte floppy disk drive.
o  8 Mbyte standard 70 ns memory upgradable to 128 Mbytes. 
o  256 Kbyte cache standard.
o  Flash BIOS.

HIGHLIGHTS

o  The TZ87N drives and TZ877 autoloaders provide the same capacity and 
   performance as Digital's industry leading TZ87 DLT tape drives -- at a 
   significantly lower cost

o  They are ideal for backup, archiving, and some data interchange 
   applications for users with compact discs, 9 track drives, or other 
   TK/DLT drives as load mechanisms for their Digital software 

o  They differ from earlier members of the DLT family in only one respect: 
   they do not read TK media
