 SELECTED DECNIS 500

 PROCESSOR CARDS AND
 PACKAGED SYSTEMS
                        
                        Note: The MPC-I card (DNSAN-AH) does not
                        have sufficient memory to run some of the
                        features in the DECNIS Software V3.1,
                        which requires the MPC-II (DNSAN-BH).
                        With this change, DECNIS should now be
                        ordered a la carte using the DECNIS 500-
                        SPX and DECNIS 600-SPX base platforms,
                        which include MPC-II; all network
                        interface cards must now be ordered
                        separately. The replacement platforms
                        include the MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) and can,
                        therefore, run DECNIS V3.1 and future
                        software releases. Existing users whose
                        DECNIS systems use the MPC-I will
                        continue to receive hardware and software
                        maintenance for a period of nine months
                        from September 1996. These users can
                        upgrade to MPC-II under a trade-in
                        program (4A-DNSAN-UG).
