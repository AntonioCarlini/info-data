o  Limited OpenVMS support for the RZ26B drive in OpenVMS V5.5-1 and OpenVMS 
   V5.5-2.

   Digital has successfully tested the RZ26B drive under OpenVMS V5.5-1 and 
   V5.5-2 as a generic SCSI device and is making it available at this time 
   with limited support. Because device name recognition for the RZ26B drive 
   was not included in these OpenVMS releases, users will find that OpenVMS 
   software identifies the "device type" of this disk as "Generic" instead 
   of "RZ26B" (for example, $ Show device /full).

Low-Cost 17-inch Monochrome VXT 2000 Terminal

HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS

As with all other variants of the VXT 2000 family, the 17-inch single box 
model uses the VAX SOC microprocessor with floating point. It supports 
ThinWire, thick wire, and Twisted Pair (10BaseT) Ethernet connections.  The 
monitor has an adjustable tilt swivel base for additional user comfort. The 
17-inch single box also supports the DECimage option for high performance 
bitonal document image processing.

DEClaser 1152


The DEClaser 1152 printer, Digital's first printer that supports PostScript 
Level 2, is a low-cost, four-page-per-minute desktop laser printer.  
Individual users will be able to selectively request PostScript or HP 
LaserJet IIP -- allowing the user to selectively print non-PostScript or 
PostScript documents from one printer.  This desktop printer device is 
ideal for a personal computing environment.

PRODUCT FEATURES/SPECIFICATIONS

o  Four page per minute print speed (text 8-1/2 x 11 inch paper)
o  300 x 300 dpi resolution
o  Resolution enhancement with DECimage software
o  PostScript Level 2 and HP PCL-4 protocols
o  Multiple paper size support: executive, legal, letter (8-1/2 x 11 inch) 
   and appropriate European equivalents, office envelopes
o  Single supplies replacement cartridge
o  17 scalable Adobe PostScript fonts
o  Customer upgradeable to 43 Adobe fonts via optional cartridge
o  Optional large capacity paper tray (250 sheets)
o  Monthly duty cycle: up to 6000 pages

Fiber, Unshielded Twisted Pair, and ThinWire Transceivers
Taken from EISNER.

HIGHLIGHTS

o  Three new MAUs -- DEFLM-AA for fiber, DETPM-AA for unshielded twisted 
   pair, and DECXM-AA for ThinWire -- each transceiver is used to connect 
   the AUI port for data terminal equipment (DTE) to their respective media 
   types

o  These new MAUs are smaller, VDE class B compliant, and have extensive 
   diagnostic capabilities

o  DECXM-AA will replace the current DESTA-BA product and DETPM-AA will 
   replace the current H3350-AA product

DECstation 5000 MODEL 200 GRAPHICS OPTIONS RETIRING

The DECstation 5000 Model 200 system was Digital's first RISC workstation 
with high performance 2D and 3D graphics accelerators. It offered superior 
accelerated 2D and 3D vector and polygon performance, along with graphics 
hardware features to support anti-aliased vectors, true color display, and 
simultaneous double and Z buffering. The last available order date is 
December 31, 1992. The last ship date is February 26, 1993.

DECstation 3100 SYSTEM RETIRING

The DECstation 3100 system was announced in January 1989. Its replacements, 
the Personal DECstation 5000 Models 20, 25, and 33, offer greater CPU 
performance, expandability, and superior graphics at a lower price than the 
DECstation 3100 system, while retaining application binary compatibility. 
The last order date is December 18, 1992. The last ship date is January 29, 
1993.

The chief characteristics of the DECstation 3100 system and the Personal 
DECstation 5000 Models 20, 25, and 33 are as follows:

                                 To             To             To
