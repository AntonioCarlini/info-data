VAX 6000 MODEL 300 MOVING TO MAINTENANCE-ONLY STATUS

With the introduction of the VAX 6000 Model 600 system, the VAX 6000 Model 
300 system has been moved to maintenance-only status.  The VAX 6000 Model 
300 family, however, subject to availability, will continue to be available.  
Announcements about the retirement of individual options will be made at a 
later time.

For new users, the current VAX 6000 product offerings -- Model 410, 510, and 
600 systems -- are recommended.
