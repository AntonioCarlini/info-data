DECstation 5000 MODEL 125 RETIRING

TheThe DECstation 5000 Model 100 series computers are UNIX based RISC 
workstations featuring the MIPS R3000A CPU and R3010 FPU chipset running at 
25 MHz and 33 MHz. The design of these systems places the CPU/FPU chipset on 
a 3 x 5 inch (7.6 x 12.7 cm) removable daughter card that permits upgrading 
of processing power simply by replacing the existing cards with the higher 
performing daughter cards.
